# SWARM Web

This repository hosts the official website for **SWARM**, a university student robotics team based in Canada. The site is intended to serve as an online presence for the team, showcasing their projects, events, and team members.

## About the Project
The website is currently **under development** and will continue to evolve as new features are added. Once complete, it will provide updates about the team's activities, event galleries, and ways for the community to get involved.

## Status
This project is a work in progress.

## Installation (Docker)

To run the project locally using Docker:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JakubStrunc/swarmweb.git

   ```

2. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```
   This should install 3 containers.
